# beta-MoTe2_centrosymm_TB_WF44
This repository contains Wannier90 input and output files for the TB model for centrosymmetric MoTe2.
This is a TB model with 44 Wannier functions in the absence of spin orbit coupling using Wannier90 v.1.2 (https://wannier.org/) developed by the Wannier90 Team.
The A_{mn} and M_{mn} files are too large to be uploaded even after compression. They can be generated by running the Wannier90 code.

We encourage you to cite the paper by S.-J. Huang, K. Park, and Y.-T. Hsu, "Hybrid-order topological superconductivity in a topological metal 1Tâ€™-MoTe2", when you use the TB parameters for your research.
