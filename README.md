# beta-MoTe2_centrosymm_TB_WF44
This repository contains A_{mn}, M_{mn}, and other Wannier90 files for the TB model for centrosymmetric MoTe2.
This is a TB model with 44 Wannier functions in the absence of spin orbit coupling using Wannier90 v.1.2 (https://wannier.org/) developed by the Wannier90 Team.

We encourage you to cite the paper by S.-J. Huang, K. Park, and Y.-T. Hsu, "Hybrid-order topological superconductivity in a topological metal 1T’-MoTe2", when you use the TB parameters for your research.
